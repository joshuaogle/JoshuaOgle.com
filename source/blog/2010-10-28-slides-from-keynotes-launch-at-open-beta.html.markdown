My favorite new project and the one responsible for starting Brightbit is <a href="http://keynot.es">Keynot.es</a>. We are starting out with a private group, including everyone who signed up during our launch at <a href="http://openbeta.extendedbeta.com">OpenBeta 5</a>, and if you haven't signed up yet you can go do that now.

But if you weren't able to make it, or would just like to reminisce, I've posted the slides over <a href="http://slideshare.net/joshuaogle">at Slideshare</a> for you to take a look. Special thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/ericboehs">Eric Boehs</a> for doing a great job giving the talk.
