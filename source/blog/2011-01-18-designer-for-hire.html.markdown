Last year was an incredibly busy year for me. I started several long-term projects with [Brightbit](http://brightb.it), got a few personal projects off the ground and helped to push [wimgo](http://wimgo.com) through huge milestones while being active in the local design and development community here in Oklahoma City.

This year is when many of those projects come to fruition, and I have had the opportunity to work with some great clients on exciting projects that I can't wait to share.

I have decided to work on freelance and contract work full time while I continue to work with Brightbit and build some ideas I've been working on for some time. Exciting things ahead. Make sure to follow me on [Dribble](http://dribbble.com/joshuaogle) and [Forrst](http://forrst.com/people/joshuaogle) to see what I'm up to.

So if you are building a mobile or web app, or just need a designer to polish that brand or website...
