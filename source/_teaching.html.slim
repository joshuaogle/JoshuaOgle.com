        I want the next generation of designers and developers to have an easier time learning than we did when I was getting started.
        That's why I spend time speaking (most recently at #{link_to "Thunder Plains", "http://thunderplainsconf.com"} and #{link_to "Refresh Denver", "http://www.meetup.com/refreshdenver"}), and running workshops
        to teach people about the #{link_to "Product Design Sprint", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w4BZNAoPHY"}.
        I have been working on a book on Design for the Web while working at thoughtbot, and I've been recording videos for a large online learning platform.
        I look forward to helping others learn however I can.
