        Great experience design is what makes a user fall in love with your product.
        It's not enough to make something pretty, and you can't just make it functional either.
        A great experience is making the user feel at home, showing them a better way to get things done.
        A great design isn't even about your product.
        <mark>It's about them.</mark>

          This OKC based startup is bringing a modern startup approach to fleet and asset tracking.
          I helped them design their entire product and identity and did a fair bit of Ruby and Google Maps Javascript too.

          The world of online learning is exploding, and Schoolkeep is leading the way by offering custom-branded school sites.
          While at thoughtbot, I got the chance to help them build their product to MVP and help onboard their first few hires.
          My history designing CMS sites and admin areas came in handy to create a great experience for both teachers and students.

          Worked together with other thoughtbot Denver designers to design and build a mobile app to help our friends get around town for our annual company summit.
          I was the sole developer, and using #{link_to "Ionic", "https://ionic.io"} made it possible to build quickly and work on everyone's devices.

          thoughtbot volunteered some time to help work on a redesign of the Ember.js Guides.
          Ember is my favorite Javascript framework, mainly because of its amazing community, so I was happy to help out with their guides.
          It's a fairly simple #{link_to "Middleman", "http://middlemanapp.com"} set up, but I'm proud that we produced one of the best looking guides of any open-source project.

          Carma provides insight into what the world is saying about your brand.
          This was the most intensive data-visualization project that I have had the chance to work on, and I got to dig into #{link_to "D3 and custom charting", "https://d3js.org"}, which was a lot of fun.
          There were around ten custom charts to design and develop and creating a shared framework for them was a fun challenge.

          The American Physical Society (APS) is the worldâ€™s largest organization of physicists, representing over 50,000 scientists.
          Their editors needed a way to accept research papers while taggint hem with the right subjects to get them to the right editors.
          I helped them design an intuitive interface for their tagging system and learned a lot of Angular to boot.
          It looks complicated, but it makes a very complicated system much easier to use and their users love the new system.
