summary: "Carma provides insight into what the world is saying about your brand. This was the most intensive data-visualization project that I have had the chance to work on, and I got to dig into #{link_to 'D3 and custom charting', 'https://d3js.org'}, which was a lot of fun. There were around ten custom charts to design and develop and creating a shared framework for them was a fun challenge."
