Balance is great example
of how viewers give physical dimensions
to non-physical things.
Balance is usually described
as how “heavy” elements feel to the viewer
according to how elements are arranged.

For displaying text,
it’s best to provide a comfortable experience
for the user to focus on the words.
Users don’t want to be constantly distracted
by something other than the content,
but we can use balance and imbalance
to help affect user behaviors
and keep things visually interesting.

The most important things
that influences visual weight are:

1. Contrast and Color
2. Texture and patterns
3. Identifiable shapes

<strong>Contrast</strong> is the visual difference
between the lightness and darkness
of visual elements.
If a page has a white background,
a black element
is going to feel “heavier”
than a gray element of the same size,
and the opposite is also true
for darker colored backgrounds.

<strong>Color</strong> can have just as much influence
on visual weight as contrast does.
Remember that colors
that invoke action,
like red and orange,
will draw more attention
than calmer colors
like blue and green.
Choosing an appropriate level of contrast
while choosing color palettes and font sizes
establishes a proper hierarchy
and is essential for accessibility.

You can balance layouts
that need to have different size elements
by giving one a color
that contrasts more
with the rest of the page.

Designing for digital devices
means that we can’t create physical <strong>texture</strong>,
so we have to simulate it,
usually by using an image.
Small changes in contrast
and the illusion of tactile interaction
can help to balance the whole.

People’s brains unconsciously look
for <strong>identifiable shapes and objects</strong>
that need special attention.
Shapes that draw the most attention
are things that look like faces,
bodies of humans or animals,
letters and symbols.
It’s such a hard-wired part
of how we process visual information
that we tend to see faces
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">that aren’t even there</a>.
These shapes grab for our attention
in a very different way
but will feel “heavier”
than something else
of a similar size.
This comes up when designing
areas that pair words and images,
like a big “hero” region
on a marketing page.

If a design is unbalanced,
it grabs for our attention
and feels uncomfortable,
but sometimes you may want to create tension,
like if you are building
an exciting and dynamic graphic area.
Knowing how to tasetfully bend the rules
to create the right level of comfort
and tension can make a great design.

## Symmetry

Symmetry is the description
of how things are balanced,
and plays an important part
in how comfortable we are
looking at content
for an extended amount of time.

In the early days of web design,
text-heavy content and small screens
meant that most web pages
were single columns and full-width.
As screens got bigger
and CSS improved,
designs started to borrow
from the world of print design
to put text in multiple columns
and limiting text lines
to readable lengths.

The simplest form of symmetry
is <strong>horizontal symmetry</strong>,
which is balance between
the left and right sides
of the image.
When we have two sides
that are well balanced,
it gives the layout
a solid foundation
and feels very comfortable.
This is part of why
layouts with a large main column
and a smaller side column
are so popular,
and also why they can feel so uncomfortable
when one of those columns
is significantly longer
than the other.

Dropbox uses symmetry
to pair descriptive text
with a fun illustration
to give the impression of simplicity
and stability.

The two other types of symmetry
are <strong>vertical symmetry</strong>
and <strong>rotational (or radial) symmetry</strong>.
We don’t usually need to think
about vertical symmetry
in web pages with scrolling content,
but it may be necessary to keep in mind
for graphics-heavy designs
or if the design uses the full area
of the viewport.
Rotational symmetry is hard to navigate
and hierarchy can seem alien
and unfamiliar.
As you can imagine it is also very difficult
to create these kinds of layouts
using the grid-based positioning techniques
that we use most.
An interesting use of rotational symmetry
is on the home screen
of the Apple Watch,
featuring a hexagonal grid.
It will be interesting to see
if this style will catch on
and if the design hurdles can be overcome.

## Centered

<em>Centered layouts</em> largely avoid the problems
of managing symmetry by offering
the simplest possible layout.
Whitespace on the left and right sides
gives the content some “breathing room”
and makes readability much easier.
This works best
for when you are wanting
to showcase your content
without any clutter,
such as a marketing page,
a blog post,
or a photo gallery.

Typography and hierarchy
become very important
and help keep your content
from coming across as boring.
Centered layouts can feel sparse
unless the text is very readable
and there is imagery
to give the content some personality.
Pay extra attention
to design for the content
that you do have.

<a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> redesigns their marketing pages often,
<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2977">doing rigorous testing</a>
to ensure that their content
makes an impact
in a clear and simple way.
If you look through their past iterations,
the designs become
more and more about storytelling.
There is a clear progression
to each page
and there are plenty
of options to sign up
appearing at regular intervals.

<a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> uses a centered layout
for similar reasons
with their marketing pages,
but they have the added challenge
of needing to design a multitude
of separate product lines
while keeping them under the same style guide.
Using a centered design
helps to make sure that each product
gets the readers’ undivided attention
and still gives them plenty of room
to focus on each feature
and story that they want to tell.

## Asymmetry

<img src="https://images.thoughtbot.com/cp-design-for-the-web/GuT8M6JBS6OiUwXsGCzZ_elements-balance-rdio.png" alt="Rdio">

Brands like <a href="http://rdio.com">Rdio</a> purposely tip the viewer off-balance
by keeping their layouts mostly asymmetrical.
Lifestyle apps and sports clothing sites
often use asymmetry
to make the content feel as dynamic
as their customers.
Music apps have followed in their footsteps
and Rdio does a great job
using just enough symmetry
to make it easy to navigate
while creating a fun and chaotic stage
for their marketing material.
As you might expect,
the more text-heavy inner pages
do switch to a more traditional two-column layout.
