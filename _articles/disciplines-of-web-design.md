summary: "A map through the confusing territory of modern web design, and a history of how we got here."
---

Fundamentally, the web is a content delivery system.
In the early days
of dial-up modems and green-on-black monochrome monitors,
text was all we could deliver
with any kind of speed.
We listened to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0">sweet song</a>
of the 2400bit/s modem,
tried to make the best pixel art that we could,
or settled for creating art from ASCII characters.
And we liked it!

Nobody liked it;
it was terrible.
But steadily things improved
and now the web is filled
with streaming video and complex animations,
delivered to a variety of devices
with a dizzying assortment
of screen sizes and capabilities.
Text is still the main method
of communication on the web
and most likely it always will be,
so the practice of “Web Design”
centers largely around
how to present the written word
and navigate a nested hierarchy of information.

Designing websites,
whether they are simple pages
or complex applications,
relies on a wide spectrum
of design disciplines.

## Visual Design

Visual Design
(usually synonymous with <em>Graphic Design</em>)
focuses on the strategic use
of design principles
to create attractive images.

This is what most people
think of when they think of web design.
The great part about the web
is that it touches and draws
from so many kinds of design,
but as a primarily visual communication platform,
visual design remains very important.

Designing products also includes things
like logo design, iconography,
and even marketing materials.
These all fall under the visual design umbrella
without even really touching the app itself.
This can be the hardest part
for a designer to feel confident about
because it can seem
like designers manifest them out of thin air.
It just isn’t true.

Do your customers describe your product
as “friendly” or “powerful”?
Is it “simple” or “useful”?
These are impressions
that are intentionally designed
through a series of small choices and critiques.

Visual design principles
like <em>color</em>, <em>form</em>, <em>space</em>, and <em>rhythm</em>,
as well as bigger concepts like <em>typography</em>
and <em>abstraction</em> vs. <em>skeumorphism</em>
all include their own terminology
and conventions that make it much easier
to craft a design language
that gives your brand its own unique personality.

## User Interface Design

The easiest way for developers
to get involved in design
is through <em>User Interface design</em>.
The user interface is everything
that the user can interact with.
UI Design is often synonymous
or at least largely overlapping
with <em>interface design</em>.
For the web,
this commonly includes design patterns for
navigation, forms, maps, et cetera.
If your workplace differentiates
between “Designers”
and “Front-End Developers”,
this is their common ground.
UI Design aims to bridge the gap
between what the software needs
and what the user expects.

Because designing interfaces
is inherently tied to its medium,
the product of this design process
is usually not a static design,
but a coded prototype.
This means that interaction design
works best if the designer
is the one writing the code,
or at the very least
is intimately aware
of how it should be coded.

As an example,
imagine that we need the user’s address
to ship them a product from a store.
We have a few options for how to do that:

- Stick to simple text fields.
- Ask for their zip code to prefill the city and state inputs.
- Detect their location from their browser for part of their address
- After getting the shipping address, default to the same billing address
- Offer to save multiple addresses for future use?

<img src="https://images.thoughtbot.com/cp-design-for-the-web/jzQuuC2dSCO3sAhtX4kT_design-ui.png" alt="" title="Critiquing options for UI elements">

For each of these options,
a UI Designer needs to understand
how the options fit within the patterns
already in the application,
and how they might be coded
while keeping in mind the limitations
of the browser and software stack.

The user interface might be influenced
by the stylistic choices
of the visual design,
but its main goal is efficiency
through affordances.

<blockquote>
“…the term affordance refers
to the perceived and actual properties
of the thing,
primarily those fundamental properties
that determine just how the thing
could possibly be used.
[…]
Plates are for pushing.
Knobs are for turning.
Slots are for inserting things into.
Balls are for throwing or bouncing.
When affordances are taken advantage of,
the user knows what to do just by looking:
no picture, label, or instruction needed.”

- Donald Norman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107">“The Design of Everyday Things”</a>, 1988
</blockquote>

The best digital user interfaces
bridge the gap between
the physical and abstract,
using established conventions
while familiarizing the user
with new design patterns.

## User Experience Design

<em>User Experience design</em> (or <em>UX design</em>) is the sum
of the other disciplines,
but it is also a lot more.
Something as vague as “experience”
means spanning multiple disciplines,
and they may involve multiple designers
with specialized roles,
but the common language
is user experience.

UX Design touches a wide array
of design disciplines
and it is important
for a specialist
to have some familiarity
with each of them:


- User Testing
- Gathering and presenting statistics
- Writing Documentation
- Visual Design
- Interface Design
- Usability
- Prototyping
- Copy writing


It isn’t important
for them to master each of these fields,
and a UX Designer might even have a background
in psychology or mathematics
rather than one in art or design.
Because of this,
some specialists have chosen
to start referring to themselves
as <em>UX Architects</em>, <em>Experience Strategists</em>,
or something similar.
They might even specialize
in a subset of these disciplines,
but the important part
is that they investigate user behavior
to best deliver the experience
that solves what the user wants.

How do you find out what the user wants?
Listen to them.

User testing, research, and rapid prototyping
are the best tools
in the UX Designer’s utility belt.
They allow us
to back up or disprove our assumptions
and get to know our users better.
A UX specialist spends a lot of time
crafting wireframes,
validating design ideas,
and talking directly to the consumers.

Start with what really matters to your users
and solve their pain points
in order of importance.
Unless you are a powerhouse like Google,
you don’t need to be testing <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662273">41 shades of blue</a>.
Use analytics to get some insight
on where your users are getting hung up.
Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B testing</a> to test out
some possible solutions.

The color palette is nice,
but how does it make the user <em>feel</em>?
Should we de-emphasize destructive actions,
or does the user need all of their options
within easy reach?

A great framework for user experience design
is the <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-product-design-sprint">Product Design Sprint</a>,
which was <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint">originated by Google Ventures</a>,
and can be <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/design-spiking">tweaked or scaled down</a>
to best fit your needs.
These can be done
at the beginning of a project
or to mentally map an individual feature.

You shouldn’t feel overwhelmed
by the breadth of this discipline,
as long as you have the complete experience in mind
while crafting your product,
you are practicing UX Design.
As you are able to test a hypothesis here
or an assumption there,
do it objectively,
and act on the results.
This pattern of frequent analysis, prototyping, and testing
will let you iteratively improve
and keep you on the right track.

Design isn’t something
that you can (or should!) do in a vacuum.
Although putting unfinished ideas
in front of a potential user
can be frightening at first,
the quick iteration
and validation of your direction
is something that you will find
reassuring and empowering.
