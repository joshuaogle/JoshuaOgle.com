No themes here. Made in a text editor like we used to with:
- Built with [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org)
- Heading font is the beautiful [Tiempos Headline](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-headline/)
- Cards are animated using [`react-parallax-tilt`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax-tilt)
- The little toggle in the footer is using [`HeadlessUI`](https://headlessui.com)
- Social icons are [`Heroicons`](https://heroicons.com)
- Everything else was made and written by me
